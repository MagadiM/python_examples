# Python Code Examples
It will contain both assignment files and weekly coding challenges

## user_input.py
The file contains the simple code of a program that prompts the user to answer a few personal questions then returns a personalized greeting based on the answers provided.

## my_list.py
This file tests the different python methods that can be used with lists. Methods used in the file include append(), pop(), insert(), and sort(). These methods are significant when handling lists in the python programming language.

## calculate_discount.py
The calculate_discount file contains a code that prompts the user to provide the price of an item and its discount rate. The function created also checks whether the disocunt is equal to 20% or higher. For discounts below 20% the discount is disregraded and it returns the original price while thos which are higher the discount is applied. In this code I used the try.. except error to ensure all conditions were met. 

# Weekly Challenges
These challenges are placed to challenge me to understand the concepts better and do more practice. There are various files done within the sub folder necessary to the learning process.
