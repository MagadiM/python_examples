# Python Code Examples
It will contain both assignment files and weekly coding challenges

## user_input.py
The file contains the simple code of a program that prompts the user to answer a few personal questions then returns a personalized greeting based on the answers provided.

## my_list.py
This file tests the different python methods that can be used with lists. Methods used in the file include append(), pop(), insert(), and sort(). These methods are significant when handling lists in the python programming language.

## calculate_discount.py
The calculate_discount file contains a code that prompts the user to provide the price of an item and its discount rate. The function created also checks whether the disocunt is equal to 20% or higher. For discounts below 20% the discount is disregraded and it returns the original price while thos which are higher the discount is applied. In this code I used the try.. except error to ensure all conditions were met. 

## error_handling and file_handling
In programming you have to be absolutely certain that you can handle any errors thrown your way effectively. Therefore, it is important to look into the errors available in python, how to catch and make exceptions. Error handling is simply a guideline into the use of error handlers in python and how they affect the codes written. File handling is simply a way to look into handling of external files using py files.

# Weekly Challenges
These challenges are placed to challenge me to understand the concepts better and do more practice. There are various files done within the sub folder necessary to the learning process. The challenges include works on python examples that push one to think in an out of the box kind of way to help them enhance their skills within the language.
